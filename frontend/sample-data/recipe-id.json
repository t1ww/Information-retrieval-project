    "instructions": "Open lamb out flat, place the fat-side down on a board.  Using a meat mallet or  rolling pin pound the lamb to even thickness. Combine herbs, rind, garlic,  pepper and butter in a small bowl; spread the mixture over the fat-side of the  lamb. Place lamb in a large shallow dish, drizzle the juice over.  Cover,  refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. Place the potatoes and onions in a large  roasting dish; drizzle with oil.  Bake uncovered, in a moderately hot oven 20  minutes. Place lamb, fat-side up, over the vegetables in the roasting dish.  Bake uncovered in moderately hot oven about 40 minutes or until lamb doneness as  desired. Remove the lamb from the dish, cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Drain the excess juices from the pan, bake potatoes and onions in a very hot  oven another 15 minutes or until crisp. Slice lamb and serve with the  vegetables.",
